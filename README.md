(I am not affiliated with the SEC or Donnelly Financial)

I thought that the SEC has made huge improvements to their data offerings, but they haven't!  A company called Donnelly Financial made a better api and have made it available to people on a test basis for two weeks and then you have to pay.  I tried to sign up to get a key and a lady gave me a bunch of obtuse answers and then never gave me a key.  If you sign up, you need to wait an hour for the key to be activated.  My key never got activated, not even the next day, I asked about it and the lady said, you need to wait an hour.  I explained again that I had waited an hour and then I also waited until the next morning and tried again and the key still wasn't working.  Then she asked me what I was trying to accomplish, was I going to make a product or a service and I told her that I was making an open source library of the api and then once I made the library I was going to see what I am able to make.  Then she asked me which api I wanted to test and I said that I needed to test all of the apis because I was making a library and that I had followed the spec very closely so that I thought that it would work then she never wrote back and the stock market dropped 724 points.  Probably just a coincidence right?  So I am not sure if this library works, but it is probably is pretty darn close.  Pull requests are welcome?
